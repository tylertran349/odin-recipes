        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Baby back ribs are tender and delicious when slowly smoked. Follow these easy steps to get amazing, flavorful, and tender BBQ ribs.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 racks baby back ribs (about 3 pounds each)</li>
            <li>1/4 packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp chili powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp paprika</li>
            <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tsp mustard powder</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 lemon, halved</li>
            <li>1 apple, quartered</li>
            <li>1 cup apple juice or cider</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil, for brushing</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Special Equipment Needed</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8-10 cups mesquite wood chips</li>
            <li>Small spray bottle</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Position the ribs meat-side down. Insert a paring knife under the membrane that covers the back of the rack. Loosen the membrane with the knife. Grab the membrane with your fingers and peel off completely.</li>
            <li>Combine the brown sugar, chili powder, paprika, cumin, mustard powder and 2 tablespoons salt in a small bowl. Rub the ribs all over with the cut sides of the lemon and then the spice mixture and place in a large roasting pan or resealable plastic bag. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, soak the wood chips in water 1 hour, then prepare your grill for smoking, filling the smoker box with one-quarter each of the wood chips and apple.</li>
            <li>About 30 minutes before smoking, remove the ribs from the refrigerator and let stand at room temperature. Meanwhile, combine the apple juice, Worcestershire sauce and vinegar in a small spray bottle. Shake to mix.</li>
            <li>Once the grill reaches 250 degrees F, lightly brush the grates with vegetable oil and place the ribs on the cooler side of the grill, meat-side up. Spray with the apple juice mixture. Close the grill and let smoke 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Replenish the smoker box with another one-quarter each of the wood chips and apple. Flip the ribs so they're meat-side down with the opposite edge of the racks closer to the smoker box. Spray with the apple juice mixture; close the grill and let smoke 1 more hour. Repeat this process every hour until the ribs are dark brown and tender and the meat starts to shrink away from the bones, about 2 more hours. Remove the ribs from the grill and let rest 5 minutes before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
